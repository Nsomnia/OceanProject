#OceanProject
An Ocean Simulation project for Unreal Engine 4. **Focusing on submersibles (submarine) dynamics.**

#####**What Is This Repo?**

This is **Nsomnias** fork of the amazing community ocean project for Unreal Engine 4 by DotCam and TK-Master. I will be making changes on this fork as my C++ skills increase and as my game gets further along in development. More details about the games pre-development can be found here http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showthread.php?t=218165

#####**Planned features** as soon as possible
- Typhoon/Hurricane style weather simulation
- Underwater currents
- Underwater temperature changes (thermo-clines)
- Procedural ocean floor generation
- Bow waves
- Simple Wakes -> Kelvin Wakes
- Foam
- More water displacment simulation
- More realistic simulation of submarine style buoyancy (tanks of air filled/removed of water)

#####**Changelog**
Jan. 27 2016 - Forked Repo

######**Where to get it?**
**4.9 Branch - This is the most up to date branch compatible with UE 4.9**
